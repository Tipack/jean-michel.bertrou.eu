<h1>This website was made with ruhoh</h1>

<p>and I think it is great</p>

<p>but the learning curve could be in my opinion improved a lot by a tool that would detect common mistakes in the spirit of what <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/cmd/doctor.rb?source=c">brew doctor</a> does for <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew, the great mac os x command-line installer</a></p>

<p>Here are things I would hope to see</p>

<h2>Check if everything is installed</h2>

<p>what I did</p>

<p>368  cd Forge/github
  372  mv bertrou.eu old_bertrou.eu
  373  git clone git://github.com/ruhoh/blog.git bertrou.eu
  374  cd bertrou.eu/
  375  bundle -v                        # note here
  376  gem install bundler      # doesn&#39;t work
  468  which ruby
  469  ruby --version               # ruby is outdated :(</p>

<p>what would have helped me</p>

<p>$ bundle exec ruhoh doctor
  # Checking if everything is installed
  # :( your ruby version is outdated
  # it seems that you are running MacOS 10.6
  # we recommand you to install homebrew http://brew.sh
  # then simply do 
  brew doctor
  brew install ruby</p>

<p>then if I do this and run it a second time</p>

<p>$ bundle exec ruhoh doctor
  # Checking if everything is installed
  # :) ruby version is fine
  # :( Bundle is not installed. You can do this
  gem install bundler
  # the gem is not in your current environnment
  gem install ruhoh
  # rackup is not running, do this in a separate shell
  rackup -p 9292</p>

<h2>making it your own</h2>

<p>I did some mistakes here but it was mostly straigtghforward</p>

<p>477  git remote rm origin
   # create an empty repository on github
  478  git remote add origin git@github.com:internaciulo/bertrou.eu.git
  481  export EDITOR=vim
  491  git pull origin master
  492  ls
  493  echo test &gt; README.md 
  494  git add .
  495  git commit -m &quot;Second version created with http://ruhoh.com/&quot;
  496  git push origin </p>

<h2>using the command line</h2>

<p>I did often this mistake :</p>

<p>499  ruhoh compiled/
  500  ruhoh compile</p>

<p>Here we see the need for a <a href="http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org">bash_completion thing</a> helper :-) </p>

<h2>ruhoh compiles but does nothing</h2>

<p>I then had did a lot of trial and errors to try to compile my markdown files</p>

<p>500  ruhoh compile
  501  ruhoh compile
  502  ruhoh compile
  503  ruhoh compile
  505  git commit -m &quot;ruhoh compile but does nothing&quot;</p>

<p>What would have helped me</p>

<p>$ ruhoh doctor
  # Checking repositories
  # :( ruhoh does not know anything about the following repositories
  # - bouquins
 # - design-et-feedback
 # - diversite-linguistique-et-esperantisme
 # - drafts
 # - mac
 # - merci
 # - partials
 # - permis-de-surfer
 # - pourquoi-ce-site
 # - stylesheets
 # - traduction
 # You probably forgot to update your config.yml file
 # See the documentation here http://ruhoh.com/docs/2/configuration/</p>
